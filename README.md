# Collaborative-Filtering
Introduction
In the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, recommender systems play a pivotal
role in enhancing user experience by providing personalized recommendations tailored to
individual preferences. Collaborative filtering, a widely used technique in recommender systems,
focuses on predicting user preferences based on the behavior and preferences of similar users.
This project explores the application of collaborative filtering using artificial neural networks
(ANNs) to develop an advanced recommendation system for books.
